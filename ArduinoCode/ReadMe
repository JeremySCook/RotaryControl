Arduino Code including Encoder Libraries that will need to be placed in same directory as main code

Rotary-shortcut-1-capslock.ino adds functionality for ring to light up blue when caps lock key is on.

Rotary-shortcut-3-locks-jog.ino gives an indication of caps lock, scroll lock, and num lock.
Does away with game functionality as shown in the demo video, but replaces it with a "jog" function
that adjusts volume up and down intermittently to keep computer awake (in case your power management is
acting screwy).
